## About
This project includes the following programs:
* VBTest:  A sample program with control of sound, outputs, polling of inputs, and setting the clock, as well as the possibility testing/executing Lego Assembly (LASM) commands
* LegoJoy:  Joystick control where every command comes from the VB program
* JoyRCX:  Joystick control where the VB program sends one command every cycle, which is then interpreted by a LASM program first downloaded and run in the RCX

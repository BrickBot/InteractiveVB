<P>This program is based on software found in the SDK2.0 by Lego. </P>
<P>Extra functions make it easier to use this as an editor for LASM as well as Mindscript programs.</P>
<P>Also you can initiate some functions directly using the buttons.</P>
<P>If you study the listing of this program it should be possible (together with the 'vpb.hlp' help-file), to make your own programs in VB to control the RCX2.0.</P>
<P>Because of the time needed to communicate, it can be an advantage to send and recieve only one variable each cycle, which is interpreted in a program in the RCX.</P>
<P>I have 2 examples, where I use Joystick steering, with 2 commands each cycle the respons time on changes in joystick position is about 1 second (to long) the other (with only 2 commands each cycle is about 0.3 s.</P>
<P>For using immediate commands (and optimal code) as used when sending commands directly from VB, programming in LASM is better.</P>
<P>When making large programs working in the RCX 'Mindscript' is easier.</P>
